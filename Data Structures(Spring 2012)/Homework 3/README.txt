Expression Tree

This program is designed to work with two source files,DisplaySimpleTree.java and Analyzer.java. The Analyzer handles all manipulations involving the infix and postfix expressions.

This program is intended to taken in an infix expression and convert it into an expression tree. This program has four buttons in its interface: “Infix to Postfix”, “Postfix to Tree”, “Evaluate Expression Tree”, and “Tree to Infix”. The buttons are intended to be pressed in this specific order. When the “Postfix to Tree” button is pressed, a new window will open up with the fully drawn expression tree. This program handles infix expressions consisting of -+*/%, parenthesis, positive integers and positive real numbers. This program does not handle negative numbers or the “^” operator.
