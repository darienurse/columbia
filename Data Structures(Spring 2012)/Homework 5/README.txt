Program 1: This program is designed to display a US map with several connections and then reduces the map to MST representation via Kruskal’s algorithm. The program’s GUI has four buttons intended to be pressed in the following order: Read File, Calculate Distances, Draw Map, and Draw MST Map. All text is displayed at the bottom of the GUI. This program takes one command line argument which references a text file containing the cities and their coordinates.

Program 2: This program reads in a text file that contains the letters of a 3D Word Hunt matrix, coordinates of each letter, and the coordinates of its adjacent letters. The program’s GUI has four buttons intended to be pressed in the following order: Read File, Draw Hunt, and HUNT! The hunt button’s method may take up to 40 seconds to resolve. The program utilizes a hash table to organize the dictionary and uses recursion on each node and its adjacencies to locate valid words. All text is displayed at the bottom of the GUI. This program takes three arguments: a 3D word hunt text file, a dictionary text file, and a number indicating the length of the words found by the algorithm. The GUI’s center contains a graphic of the 3D matrix and attempts to show an animation of each letter as it is visited (usually fails).
