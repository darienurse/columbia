Fixel
=====

Columbia University Programming Languages and Translators spring 2014 project

High level image editing language that translates to python (v 2.7).
Requires PIL (recommend Pillow).
Fixel programs can be translated and executed with the fixel script in the top level of the repo as follows:

fixel [fixel source file] [image file path(s)]

Add Fixel repo to your path to invoke from anywhere. On Windows, python must be invoked explicitly with fixel script as fist argument.

For language tutorial and LRM, see project report in repo. test.fxl also shows a sample program.
