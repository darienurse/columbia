# Paper Writing:
1. download pandoc and latex: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html
2. write the sections in markdown files: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ (see whitepaper for a very basic example)
3. to compile: run the ./run-me.sh shell script
4. open the paper.pdf file to check your work!
5. if the script yells at you, there is probably an error? i hope it doesn't yell at you.

## TO ADD A SECTION TO THE PAPER: 
- lines 60-63 of paper.tex are examples of including a markdown section in the paper
- use “\input{./sections/tutorial.tex}” syntax to add your section
- write that the document is a .tex file even if it is a markdown file!

## TO ADD CODE TO THE PAPER:
- the source code section demonstrates how to add code from the other sections of the repo into the paper
- feel free to add code you'd like to hand in!
